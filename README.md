# Cat-and-Dog-Audio-Classification
The machine model audio classification project for dog and cat classification was developed using convolutional neural networks using tensorflow. 
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can differentiate dog sounds from cat sounds. 
This project involves datasets obtained from Kaggle with a total of 277 dog and cat datasets. 
The result is a model that can differentiate between dog and cat sounds via a spectrogram, this model has an accuracy rate of around 88 percent. 
The metrics used in testing this model are the confusion matrix and classification report to see the values of precision, recall, f1-score, and also model accuracy.
